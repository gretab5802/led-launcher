# LED Launcher

Project statement: How might I control specific motors with the motion of my hand?

## Description

Given three LEDs, three servo motors, and a gyroscope accelerometer, tilt the accelerometer side to side to change which LED will light up. The LEDs correspond to the three motors. Once the desired motor to activate is selected, tilt the accelerometer back toward the user to "prepare" the motor. Then, quickly move it away from the user to activate the motor. If the motor is quick enough, you can use it to launch small paper balls at friends!

## Getting Started

Requires three LEDs, three servo motors, one gyroscope accelerometer, one Arduino board, and the required connective material (breadboard, wires, etc.). Other types of motors are applicable to this project, but code may vary slightly between them (e.g., servo vs stepper).

### Dependencies

* Arduino IDE, available for Windows, Linux, and macOS
